Hello! I made this website for a help a student for their project. The artworks here are made by <a href=https://www.instagram.com/itsjust.ari_>Arianell Atienza</a>. The photos are downloaded from Google.

This is not a fully functioning website but only the front-end. 

It is written in **HTML**, **CSS**, and very little **JavaScript**. It uses **Bootstrap 5** for it's responsive capabilities.

To see the working website access this link:
